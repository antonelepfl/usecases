  - Get latest changes: `git fetch --all`
  - Reset branches:
    - Go to DEV `git checkout dev`
    - Replace with original changes `git reset --hard upstream/dev`
- Make your changes on DEV branch
- ....
- Build container `docker build -t usecases-local .`

- Open in the browser with `http://localhost:8282/#/categories`
- Select the category of your use case
- The use case will be shown as it is in the Brain Simulation Platform

### To deploy in a dev environment:
* The user make a pull request to the `dev` branch
* A travis plan is triggered to look for any error in the files.
* When the plan finishes, the owners of the repo can merge the new pull request to `dev`.
* The user receives the notification that his/her pull request was merged.
* A [jenkins plan](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/ci/job/nse.usecases-wizard.github/) is triggered.
* The new changes appear in [Online Use Cases DEV](https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/8444/nav/64015)

### To deploy in production (non notebook):
* The owner receives the confirmation from the tests and the user that everything works correctly.
* The owner create a pull request from `dev` environment to `master`.
* A [jenkins plan](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/ci/job/nse.usecases-wizard/) is triggered.
* Go to jenkins [Build with Parameters](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/ci/job/nse.usecases-wizard/build?delay=0sec) and check **release**
* The new changes appear in [Brain Simulation Platform](https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/1655/nav/28538)

### To deploy in production (notebook):
* Download the notebook that is pointed in the `file` field in **usecases.json** (Collab UUID)
* Add this notebook into *usecases/production_notebooks* folder
* Add a new field on the **usecases.json** next to `file` called `file_prod` that points to ```https://api.github.com/repos/antonelepfl/usecases/contents/production_notebooks/<category>/<notebook_name>.ipynb?ref=master``` (\*)
* Create a Pull Request to *dev* branch with this 2 changes
* After aproved in *dev* create a new Pull Request merging *dev* into *master*
* After *dev* is merged into *master* this jenkin [plan](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/ci/job/nse.usecases-wizard/) is triggered
* To release the new version of the site, tick **release** checkbox on this [plan](https://bbpcode.epfl.ch/ci/job/nse.usecases-wizard/build?delay=0sec)

### How to:
* Add new: [use case](/documentation/add_new_usecase.md) - [MOOC](/documentation/add_new_mooc.md) - [models](/documentation/add_new_model.md)
* If single cell models [change](/documentation/single_cell_model_change.md)
* The usual [path](/documentation/usual_path.md) the user follows
