The validation test evaluates the morphology in two stages:\n","<br /><br />\n","1. **Hard Constraints**<br />\n","\n","   Here we evaluate the integrity of the neuronal reconstruction in order to determine if it is appropriate for further evaluations. The evaluations here can be sub-divided into the following NeuroM features (apps):\n","   \n","   - morph_check\n","   - cut_plane_detection <br /><br />\n","   \n","2. **Soft Constraints** <br />\n","\n","Neuronal reconstructions that pass the 'Hard Constraints' are evaluated here for their morphometric features. The features are extracted using NeuroM's morph_stats app, wherever possible, either directly or as a combination of multiple features.\n","<br />  \n","Some of the features currently included are soma's diameter and the maximal branch order in the dendrites, besides the number of trunk sections, -X,Y,Z- extents, field's diameter and total path-length of both the axon and the dendrites.\n","<br /><br />\n","The average morphometrics of the population of neurons is then computed.
