The validation test would then evaluate the model for all parameter sets against various eFEL features. It should be noted that the reference data used is that located within the model, so this test can be considered as a quantification of the goodness of fitting the model. The results are registered on the HBP Validation Framework app. If an instance of the Model Catalog and Validation Framework are not found in the current Collab, then these are created.
