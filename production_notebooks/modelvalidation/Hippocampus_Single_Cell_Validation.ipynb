The experimental dataset used for validation is obtained from UCL. The This test can be used for both pyramidal cells and interneurons.<br/><br/></dd>\n","\n","    \n","<dt>2. __Somatic Features Test - JMakara data set__:  _(for pyramidal cells)_</dt>\n","<dd>It evaluates the model against various eFEL features under somatic current injection of varying amplitudes.

The This test can be used only for pyramidal cells.<br/><br/></dd>\n","\n","<dt>3. __Depolarization Block Test__:  _(for pyramidal cells)_</dt>\n","<dd>The Depolarization Block Test aims to determine whether the model enters depolarization block to prolonged, high intensity somatic current stimulus. It compares the current intensity to which the model fires the maximum number of action potentials, the current intensity before the model enters depolarization block (the two should be equal) and the equilibrium potential during depolarization block to the experimental data of Bianchi et al. 2012 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10827-012-0383-y).<br/><br/></dd>\n","\n","<dt>4. __Back-Propagating AP Test__:  _(for pyramidal cells)_</dt>\n","<dd>The Back-Propagating AP Test evaluates the mode and efficacy of back-propagating action potentials on the apical trunk in locations of different distances from the soma. The amplitude of the first and last AP of around 15 Hz train is compared to experimental data from Golding et al. 2001 (https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2001.86.6.2998).<br/><br/></dd>\n","\n","<dt>5. __PSP Attenuation Test__:  _(for pyramidal cells)_</dt>\n","<dd>The PSP Attenuation Test evaluates how much the post synaptic potential (using EPSC stimulus) attenuates from the dendrite (different distances) to the soma. The soma/dendrite attenuation is compared to data from Magee & Cook 2000 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/78800).<br/><br/></dd>\n","    \n","<dt>6. __Oblique Integration Test__:  _(for pyramidal cells)_</dt>\n","<dd>Tests signal integration in oblique dendrites for increasing number of synchronous and asynchronous synaptic inputs.
