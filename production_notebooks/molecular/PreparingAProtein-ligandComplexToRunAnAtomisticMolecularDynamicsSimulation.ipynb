The particular example used is the **acetylcholinesterase**  protein (PDB code [1EVE](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/1EVE)), in complex with the **anti-alzheimer drug E2020 (Aricept)** (3-letter Code [E20](http://www.rcsb.org/ligand/E20)). \n","\n","\n","**Cholinesterase inhibitors** are being utilized for symptomatic treatment of **Alzheimer's disease**. **E2020**, marketed as **Aricept**, is a member of a large family of N-benzylpiperidine-based acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors.\n","\n","\n","This workflow makes extensive use of the **BioExcel Building Blocks library** ([biobb](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb)). Each step of the process is performed by a **building block** (bb), which are wrappers of tools/scripts that computes a particular functionality (e.g. Solvating a system). If you are interested in expanding/modifying the current workflow, please visit the **existing documentation** for each of the packages [here](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb). \n","\n","Although the **pipeline** is presented **step by step** with associated information, it is extremely advisable to previously spend some time reading documentation about **Molecular Dynamics simulations**, to
