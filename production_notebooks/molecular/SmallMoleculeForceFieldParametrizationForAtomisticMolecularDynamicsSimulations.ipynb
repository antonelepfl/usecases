The particular example used is the **Imipramine** molecule (PDB code [IXX](http://www.rcsb.org/ligand/IXX), DrugBank code [DB00458](https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00458)). \n","\n","\n","**Imipramine** is a tricyclic **antidepressant** (TCA) which is used mainly in the treatment of **depression**. It can also reduce symptoms of **agitation** and **anxiety**. \n","\n","\n","This workflow makes extensive use of the **BioExcel Building Blocks library** ([biobb](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb)). Each step of the process is performed by a **building block** (bb), which are wrappers of tools/scripts that computes a particular functionality (e.g. Adding hydrogens). If you are interested in expanding/modifying the current workflow, please visit the **existing documentation** for each of the packages [here](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb). \n","\n","Although the **pipeline** is presented **step by step** with associated information, it is extremely advisable to previously spend some time reading documentation about **small molecule parameterization**, to get familiar with the terms used, especially for newcomers to the field. \n","\n","***\n","**Version:** 1.0 (August 2019)\n","***\n","**Contributors:**  Adam Hospital, Pau Andrio, Aurélien Luciani, Genís Bayarri, Francesco Colizzi, Josep Lluís Gelpí, Modesto Orozco (IRB-Barcelona, Spain)\n","***\n","**Contact:** [adam.hospital@irbbarcelona.org](mailto:adam.hospital@irbbarcelona.org)\n","***\n","**Thanks:** This use case took the code to generate the data in a single folder to finally copy it to the storage collab from the **multipipsa tool to calculate the electrostatic potential surrounding a protein in aqueous solution** use case by Neil Bruce, Lukas Adam, Stefan Richter, Rebecca Wade (HITS, Heidelberg, Germany)."]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Setting up the working environment"]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Importing required libraries"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["import os, datetime, magic\n","import nglview\n","import ipywidgets\n","import zipfile\n","from hbp_service_client.storage_service.client import Client"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Set up collab storage for saving data at the end of the MD setup"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Find your own collab storage path\n","collab_path = get_collab_storage_path()\n","print(collab_path)\n","storage_client = Client.new(oauth.get_token())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Set up local directory structure"]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a local working directory\n","try:\n","    homeDir = os.environ['HOME']\n","except:\n","    print(\"Error in environment\")\n","\n","else:\n","    workDir = os.path.join(homeDir, 'IRB')\n","    if not os.path.isdir(workDir):\n","        try:\n","            os.mkdir(workDir)\n","        except:\n","            print(\"unable to make working directory\")\n","    \n","    # Make a new directory to run the use case in. \n","    # If directory already exists, add a number to make a unique name\n","    baseDir = 'SmallMoleculeParam'\n","    dirIter = 0\n","    useCaseDir = os.path.join(workDir, baseDir)\n","    print(useCaseDir)\n","    \n","    if os.path.exists(useCaseDir):\n","        while os.path.exists(useCaseDir):\n","            dirIter += 1\n","            useCaseDir = os.path.join(workDir, baseDir + '.' + str(dirIter))            \n","    \n","    try:\n","        os.mkdir(useCaseDir)\n","    except:\n","        print(\"Failed to make use case working directory\")\n","    else:\n","        print(\"Working directory for current use case: %s\" % useCaseDir)\n","        os.chdir(useCaseDir)\n",""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Defining logging output cells\n","By default, Jupyter notebooks display the logging information in **red-coloured cells**.\n","\n","Here they are redefined to different colours, depending on the **logging level** (INFO, WARNING, ERROR), in order to avoid confusions with **critical error messages**. \n","\n","If you prefer to keep the default Juyter notebooks configuration, please **disable/comment** (or just not execute) the next cell."]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":["from IPython.core.display import display, HTML\n","display(HTML('''<script>\n","const mo = new MutationObserver(\n","  mutations => mutations.forEach(mutation => {\n","    const element = mutation.target.querySelector(\n","        '.output_text.output_stderr');\n","    if (!element) return;\n","    if (element.textContent.includes('[INFO')) \n","        element.style.background = '#DDD';\n","    else if (element.textContent.includes('[WARN')) \n","        element.style.background = 'sandybrown';\n","    else if (element.textContent.includes('[ERROR')) \n","        element.style.background = 'salmon';\n","}));\n","mo.observe(document.documentElement, \n","    { childList: true, subtree: true });\n","</script>'''))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["***\n","## Input parameters\n","**Input parameters** needed:\n"," - **ligandCode**: 3-letter code of the ligand structure (e.g. IXX)\n"," - **mol_charge**: Molecule net charge (e.g. -1)\n"," - **pH**: Acidity or alkalinity for the small molecule.
