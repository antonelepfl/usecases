In a uniform dielectric medium with a dielectric constant $\\epsilon$, the electrostatic potential at a position $\\mathbf{r}$ due to a set of fixed charges $q_i$ can be calculated from Coulomb's equation:\n","\n","$$ \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right) = \\sum_i \\frac{q_{i}}{4 \\pi \\epsilon r_{i}} $$\n","\n","where $r_i$ is the distance from point $\\mathbf{r}$ to the $i^\\textrm{th}$ charge. For a protein in solution, we no longer have a uniform dielectric, as the interior has a much lower dielectric than the solvent. Here, we can calculate the potential by solving the Poisson equation: \n","\n","$$ \\bigtriangledown \\left( -\\epsilon\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right) \\cdot \\bigtriangledown \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right) \\right)  = \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right) $$\n","\n","which links the gradient of the electrostatic field ($-\\epsilon\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right) \\cdot \\bigtriangledown \\phi\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right)$) with the charge density $\\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right)$.

The total charge density in the region of the protein is then represented by the charge density due to the fixed charges in the protein ($\\rho_\\textrm{p}\\left(\\mathbf{r}\\right)$) and the dissolved ions, which are assumed to have a Boltzmann distribution.
