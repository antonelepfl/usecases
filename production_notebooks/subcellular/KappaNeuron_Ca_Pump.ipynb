Introduction\n","\n","KappaNEURON integreates a *rule-based* simulator called SpatialKappa into NEURON. Rule-based languages such as Kappa or BNGL allow models containing molecular interactions, such as binding of protein domains, and modifications, such as phosphorolation, to be described compactly, using a syntax akin to chemical reactions. Simulators such as KaSim or SpatialKappa (for Kappa) or NFSim or RuleBender (BNGL) interpret rule-based models stochastically, producing simulations of the molecular complexes over time.\n","\n","A full description of KappaNEURON is available in this paper: Sterratt, D. C., Sorokina, O. and Armstrong, J. D. (2015). ‘Integration of rule-based models and compartmental models of neurons’. Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics 7699: 143-158.

The pump model is contained in the file `caPump2.ka`. The lines describing the rules are:\n","```\n","%agent: ca(x)\n","%agent: P(x)\n","'ca binding' ca(x), P(x)     -> ca(x!1), P(x!1) @ 'k1' * 'agconc'\n","'ca release' ca(x!1), P(x!1) -> P(x)            @ 'k2'\n","```\n","The first two lines define calcium `ca` and a pump molecule `P` as *agents*, each with a binding *site* `x`. The third line describes binding of the `x` site of `ca` to the `x` site of  `P` via a *link*, denoted `!1`. The rate of this rule is given by the product of two variables `k1` and `agconc`. The fourth line describes the unbinding of calcium and the pump molecule, at a rate `k2`."]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 1.
