Furthermore, their interactions with surrounding water molecules are modeled implicitly (using random forces that mimic the collisions between solutes and water molecules). These assumptions not only speed up the calculation of the systematic forces by allowing the use of precomputed interaction grids, but also allow for larger simulation time steps, as faster vibrational motions are removed. At each simulation step, the position $r$ of solute $i$ within a system of $N$ solutes is propagated using the Ermak-McCammon equation:\n","\n","$$ \\Delta r_{i} = \\Delta t\\sum_{j=1}^{N}\\left ( \\frac{\\partial \\widehat{D}_{ij}}{\\partial r_{j}} + \\frac{\\widehat{D}_{ij}}{k_{B}T} \\cdot F_{i} \\right ) + R_{i} $$\n","\n","where $k_{B}$ and $T$ are the Boltzmann constant and simulation temperature, respectively, and $F_{i}$ is the force acting on solute $i$ due to its interactions with all other solutes. $\\mathbf{\\widehat{D}}$ is the diffusion tensor for the current configuration of the system, and $R_{i}$ is a random displacement vector obtained from the factorisation of $\\mathbf{\\widehat{D}}$. The dependence of the diffusion of one solute on the diffusion of all other solutes is due to hydrodynamic interactions, where solutes are able to feel the flow fields in solution created by the other solutes. \n","\n","Modelling hydrodynamic interactions is extremely computationally expensive, due to the need to factorise $\\mathbf{\\widehat{D}}$ at every time step. In dilute conditions, as we use rigid solutes, we can assume these interactions are negligible, simplifying the equation and removing the need for matrix factorisation:\n","\n","$$ \\Delta r_{i} = \\frac{\\Delta t}{k_{B}T} D_{i}^{T} \\cdot F_{i} + R_{i} $$\n","\n","where $ D_{i}^{T}$ is the infinite dilution translational diffusion coefficient of solute $i$, and $R_{i}$ is a random vector sampled from a Gaussian distribution with mean zero and a variance of $\\left \\langle R_{i}^{2} \\right \\rangle = 6D_{i}^{T} \\Delta t$. A similar equation is used to propagate the rotational motion of the solutes based on the torques acting on them.\n","\n","For information on the calculation of the contributions to the force $F_{i}$, see [Martinez et al (2015), Journal of Computational Chemistry, 36, 1631–1645](https://mcm.h-its.org/sda7/doc/doc_sda7/jcc23971.pdf).\n","\n","\n","** Prediction of bimolecular association rate constant **\n","\n","SDA calculates bimolecular association rate constants using the [Northrup, Allison and McCammon](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.446900) method. Here we run many thousands of Brownian dynamics trajectories, each beginning with the two solutes (molecules, in this case proteins) at a separation $b$ (shown by the b-surface in the figure below). In each trajectory, we then simulate the diffusion of one solute relative to another, until the solutes are separated by a larger distance $c$ (shown by the c-surface in the figure below).\n","\n","![bsurface_csurface](https://projects.h-its.org/mcmsoft/hbpdata/sda_bsurface_csurface.gif)\n","\n","During each trajectory, we monitor the formation of polar contacts present in the native state of the complex formed by the two solutes.
